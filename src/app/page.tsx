          I spend a lot of my time working on the backend, usually across a range of languages
          such as Python, Typescript and Rust. I also get to dabble in React Native from time
          to time, and write a lot of dev tools in bash.
        </p>
        <p className="my-2">
          Outside of work I spend my time working on open source projects, checking out new
          technologies, and an unholy amount of time configuring Neovim (it's almost perfect, I swear).
